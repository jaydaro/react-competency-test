If I had more time to invest in this application, these are the things I would do:

1) Add a details document for each friend in the details API 
2) Create ways to add, edit, and delete friends, as well as add, edit, and delete specific parts of their details
3) Determine why the photos and status array from the details API are not mappable and for some reason are undefined if I try to retrieve their length. 
4) Change the pop-up showing the details to appear directly above or below the friend that I selected
5) Add an 'X' button to the pop-up for exiting back to the friends list
